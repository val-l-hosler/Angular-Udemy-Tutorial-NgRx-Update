# Angular-udemy-tutorial-2-NgRx-update

I followed intricate instructions to complete the recipe app project from the following [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/). In addition, I independently completed most of the project before watching the instructorâ€™s solution and implemented the following changes...

1. Augmented functionality to improve user experience on the following features: login page, shopping list, edit recipe page, and add a new recipe page.
2. Fixed the following bugs in the instructorâ€™s project:
    * Ensured that the items on the shopping list are unique and the amount is appropriately updated when adding an ingredient.
    * Ensured that the ingredients per recipe are unique and the amount is appropriately updated when adding an ingredient.
    * Ensured the recipe names are unique in the recipe list.
    * Redirected a logged-in user back to their previous page if they refresh the application.
    * Made the edited recipe list persistent over page refreshes for logged-in users.
    * Made the shopping list persistent over page refreshes.
